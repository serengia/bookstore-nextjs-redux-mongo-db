# About
**Buklist.com project** is an open source project currently managed my [@serengia](https://github.com/serengia) .

**Mission** - To help people achieve their reading goals and contribute in making their
            future brighter.
            
**Motivation/back-story** - After spending 30 minutes on social media, many times I would leave
                feeling depressed instead of being uplifted. I quickly realised that millions of people feel the same and I wanted to change
                that by creating a platform that actually empowers. That's how **buklist.com** was born. Our goal
                is to make people feel proud of themselves for every minute they spend on our platform as we continue to make it better with more features. - James Serengia

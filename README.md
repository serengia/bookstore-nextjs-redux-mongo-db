# About
**Buklist.com** project is an open source project currently managed my [@serengia] .

**Mission** - To help people achieve their reading goals and contribute in making their
            future brighter.
            
**Motivation/back story** - After spending 30 minutes on social media, many times you leave
                feeling depressed instead of being uplifted. I wanted to change
                that by create a platform that actually empowers. Our goal
                is to make you feel proud of yourself for every minute you spend
                on our platform. - James Serengia

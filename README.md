# About
**Buklist.com** is an open source project with the mission to help people achieve their reading goals and contribute to making their future brighter. 

The project is currently managed by [@serengia](https://github.com/serengia).

## Motivation and Backstory
After spending 30 minutes on social media, many times I would leave feeling depressed instead of uplifted. I quickly realized that millions of people feel the same way, and I wanted to change that by creating a platform that actually empowers people. That's how Buklist.com was born.

Our goal is to make people feel proud of themselves for every minute they spend on our platform. We aim to achieve this by continuously improving our platform with new features and functionalities.

## Technology Stack
Buklist.com is built using the following technologies:

- **MongoDB** - a document-based database for storing user data.
- **Express** - a minimalist web framework for building APIs.
- **React** - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js** - a React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **Node.js** - a JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.

## üöÄ Live Application

[Live app version](https://buklist-open-source-project.vercel.app/) - NOTE: We will update the domain link to **bulkist.com** once we are through with some essential features.
